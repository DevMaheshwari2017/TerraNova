🌍 Game Overview:
In the mystical realm of Teraa Nova, two formidable factions, the Arcane Dominion (Elves) and the Mechanical Union (Humans), are locked in a relentless struggle for supremacy. Both factions have harnessed the raw power of elemental and mechanical forces to construct towering fortresses, each safeguarding a coveted ancient artifact at its core. As commanders of these factions, two players engage in intense player-versus-player (PvP) tower defense battles. Your mission? Defend your tower while orchestrating relentless assaults to breach your opponent's defenses and destroy their fortress.
